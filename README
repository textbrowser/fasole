Why use zepeto?

Suppose you have several versions of clang and gcc spread across
multiple directories. With zepeto, switching from version to version
is simple. C++11 is required.

Suppose we define the zepeto.table file as follows.

gcc4_4.description: GNU C Compiler (gcc4_4)
gcc4_4.LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/gcc-4.4/lib
gcc4_4.PATH:/usr/local/gcc-4.4/bin

gcc4_5.description: GNU C Compiler (gcc4_5)
gcc4_5.LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/gcc-4.5/lib
gcc4_5.PATH:/usr/local/gcc-4.5/bin

A zepeto -a gcc4_4 will modify your current shell's environment variables
such that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH contain the referenced directories.

A zepeto -d gcc4_4 will detach the defined directories from the current
shell's environment variables.

Local Testing

> cat $(./zepeto.bin -l -t zepeto.table)
> ./zepeto.bin -p
